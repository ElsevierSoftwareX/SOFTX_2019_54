# cuSten

A library to handle the application of a stencil operation to an array using CUDA. The primary idea being to simplify the process of doing finite difference codes in CUDA by abstracting the data handling of the array, loading it onto the device etc.

Library is currently a work in progress. Commenting currently incomplete.

The Makefile will compile the library and the examples stored at the top level of this project.
